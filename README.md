# Car Reservation App

> This is a Ruby on Rails frontend application, that is used for car rentals. The purpose of this application is to help users rent car when they move to new countries or cities. The Application allows an authenticated user to login to the system, get a list of all available cars and their cities, and book according to preference. The cars' data provides detailed information according to users preference and their budget based on different cities as well as countries. It also has dedicated pages to see a user's reservations and a reservation form.
